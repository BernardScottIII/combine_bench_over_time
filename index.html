    <h1>Welcome to My Report!</h1>
    This report is the culmination of my semester project for my introduction to data science class.
    <h2>My Data Science Class</h2>
    My data science class at the University of Scranton is an introduction
    to basic data science workflow following current best practices. This 
    course will introduce students to computational or algorithmic ways to 
    think about and learn from data. Emphasis will be placed on data 
    visualization, exploratory data analysis, and foundational modeling 
    principles and techniques implemented using an appropriate programming 
    language.
